# hip2john
 A short Python script that calculates the conversion from Hipparcos instrumental magnitudes to the Johnson Standard system using colour indices measured at Hvar observatory (or data of the same format).
 <br>Instructions are written as comments directly in the code.
 <br>Hvar observatory: https://oh.geof.unizg.hr/ (65 cm reflector). 
 <br>Hipparcos: https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Hipparcos_overview
 <br>
 <br> This code was developed for transforming data in my bachelor thesis "A study of the long-term brightness and colour variations of the Be star 88 Herculis" (https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/109974) at the Astronomical institute of Charles University in Prague.
